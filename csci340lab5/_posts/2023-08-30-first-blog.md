Welcome to my blog! This isn't my first one, as I have another one called [The Compost Bin](https://mason-t-demond.github.io/compost-bin/), which details my experience with an exciting summer research project.

I can fully say that setting this blog up was much easier than the last one was. All I had to do was fork over the Minima repository and then use Ruby to add a few necessary packages. It felt much more intuitive and I actually got the theme required. This process was so simple, in fact, that I'll soon be moving The Compost Bin to a new repository so that it can be a bit more unique. Given my prior experience with GitHub blogs, I'm not really confused about anything else but I do wonder what else Jekyll is capable of doing.

## Future Hopes
- Customization
    - I still have more ways in which I want this blog to be unique to me. Jekyll has so many other cool themes which can be found [here](https://jekyllthemes.io/free).
- More than just writing
    - I feel like Jekyll could be a cool area to show off more than just blogs, but I'm not sure what.
- Better Project Documentation
    - I feel like my documentation from the summer could definitely be improved upon, and I hope to build up those skills over the semester.
