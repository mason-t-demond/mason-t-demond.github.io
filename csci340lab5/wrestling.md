<ol start="10" reversed="reversed">
    <li>The Miz</li>
        - He's awesome, and deserves more in 2023.
    <li>Edge</li>
        - His potential retirement has me in a metaphorical chokehold.
    <li>Rhea Ripley</li>
        - This rivalry with Raquel is not a good look for her.
    <li>Raquel Rodriguez</li>
        - This rivalry with Rhea is doing great for her character.

        - I cheated a bit with this one but the whole group makes my day.
    <li>"Se√±or Money in the Bank" Damien Priest</li>

    <li>Giulia</li>
        - GIVE HER BACK THE RED BELT!!!
    <li>MJF</li>
        - Way better than that Adam Cole guy.
